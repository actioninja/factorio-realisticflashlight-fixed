# Description
Replaces the default flashlight and vehicle "light cones" with better, more realistic versions.

## Recommendations
Fits nicely with some of my favorite mods that "enhance" the night:

 * [Clockwork]
 * [Lightorio]
 * [NicerFuelGlow]

## Settings
Along these lines, it also adds startup settings for enabling the light halo around the character and vehicles, (disabled by default).
